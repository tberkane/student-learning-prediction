Machine Learning for behavioral data - Notebooks

Old notebooks and code from milestone 4 are in the `archive` directory.
Helper python modules are in the `modules` directory.

The code for the project is contained in three notebooks:
 - `1-data-prep.ipynb`: This notebook prepares the data for our different prediction tasks.	
 - `2-aggregated.ipynb`: This notebook looks into answering our research question using aggregated data as input.
 - `3-time-series.ipynb`: This notebook looks into answering our research question using time series data as input.
 - `4-data_visualization.ipynb`: This notebook looks into clustering with TSNE and identifying structure.
 - `5-session-happiness`: This notebook shifts towards predicting overall session happiness and seeking some model explanations.
