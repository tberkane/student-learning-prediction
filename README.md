Machine Learning for behavioral data - Project repository

All the code relevant to this project can be found inside the `notebooks` directory. There, all notebooks and additional helper python code needed to reproduce our results are present.

We recommend running the notebooks using Google Colab due to dataset sizes and execution speed. To mount a personal Drive to load data, run:
```
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```
and accordingly set a `DATA_DIR` variable to specify the data directory. To import code from a python file `filename.py`, run:
```
from google.colab import files
src = list(files.upload().values())[0]
open('filename.py','wb').write(src)
import filename
```
